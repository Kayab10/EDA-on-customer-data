I have done EDA on a customer dataset of UK based store and classified them on the basis of their spending, frequency of visit, and recency;
- done feature engineering to extract valuable information of the dataset;
- plot graphs for better understanding using, matplotlib and seaborn;
- used 'k-means clustering' for clustering the customer on given factors;
